## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

## Index
This index.html file is the skeleton of the landing page. Within the header, you'll find the placeholder for the navigational bar. Within the body, there are six sections that were added to start with.

## Styles
A lot of this code was provided by Udacity as starter code. The styles.css gives the look and feel of the website. A few styling changes were made for the dynamic navigation bar.

## App
All functionality is present in the app.js file. First the navigation bar is dynamically created by looping over the section elements. We loop through the number of implemented sections and generate an area in the header for each one. There is an event listener that will scroll to the correct section when a link is clicked in the navigation bar. The active section has it's own styling, as well as the link that refers to this section in the navigation bar. 

## Launch
If you want to launch this website, you can visit the github pages link below, or download or clone the repo and open index.html in your browser.
